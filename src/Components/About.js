                <b><br></br>How XENTICE Works?</b><br></br>
            </h2>
            <p>Xentice works like just another classifieds portal – it has a parallel system for customers running side by side. People who wish to sell any goods can upload their advertisements just like one is expected to do in a classifieds portal. People who wish to buy properties and business services may browse through the listing.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Sellers need to upload pictures of their properties, along with a title and description of the same and the expected sales price of the property. The buyers are allowed to browse through the several alternatives, contact the seller, negotiate with them one- to-one and then purchase the property.

                 Service Providers or Companies need to upload pictures of their business services, along with a title and description of the same and the expected price of the service they offer. The Customers / Buyers are allowed to browse through the several alternatives, contact the seller, negotiate with them one-to-one and then redeem their services.
                 <br></br><br></br>
                 The surprising fact is that Xentice doesn’t act as a liaison between the buyer and the seller. It acts as a mere catalyst for connecting the two online through a classifieds portal. The conversation, bargaining, advances, and transactions remain between the buyer and seller only. The Business Model of Xentice is actually scale- dependent. The website acts as a classifieds portal where customers can buy and sell properties. Xentice spends large amounts of money in order to garner more and more user traffic and greater frequency and number of listings. The high traffic is put to use to earn revenue by monetizing the number of clicks and searches. We also provide Featured Listing of both Properties and Services. If a seller, for example, has posted a classifieds listing of the flat he wishes to sell or rent out. After some time, the property is bound to go further below more recent listings, and would now appear on the second or third page and so on. To make it still appear on the top, the seller can pay to Xentice to ‘feature’ his listing on the top of the site. This featured listing is a source of profit to both the seller as well as Xentice. He might earn more impressions too, which are also dual sources of income for Xentice.
                 <br></br><br></br>
                 The biggest power spread of Xentice lies in India, Brazil, and Poland, though these three combined make up for just half its profits. The main strategy employed by Woxro Group behind Xentice is working on this online mega-mart in the less developed or developing countries, considering the vast ocean of opportunities here. We don’t wish to contend with the stalwarts of the US or UK and earn any competitors on the way.
